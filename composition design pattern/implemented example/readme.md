# scenario:

applicants are applying for visa from 3 categories (third-world, normal, VIP),
each applicant has to be background checked by a third party intelligence agency.
they then have to be processed with our eval system and have the results displayed to
the system operator.

---

intelligence module plays the role of third party agency, applicant module contains
the 3 required classes of applicants and eval system is responsible for notifying
the operator of the results.
